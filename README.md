This is a small demo application to visualize how an image optimization endpoint works. It also highlight server memory usage and file sizes comparing image formats, resizing operations, and buffer vs. stream processing of the optimization endpoint.

You can play around with the demo here: [img-optimization-playground.vercel.app](https://img-optimization-playground.vercel.app/)
